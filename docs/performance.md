# Performance measurements

Benchmarks write local reports under `artifacts/`, which Git ignores. Keep source
revisions and matching frontend/daemon binaries with reports when comparing
builds. Results depend on the compositor, driver, font, and machine.

## Application

```sh
python3 scripts/cargo_build.py --release gmux gmux-gtk
python3 scripts/performance-benchmark.py \
  --binary target/release/gmux-gtk --output artifacts/performance.json
```

The benchmark starts the private Wayland fixture described in [testing](testing.md).
It measures frontend and daemon CPU, resident memory, and native input-to-frame
latency with visible, hidden, detached, and idle workloads. The selected frontend
must have its matching `gmux` alongside it.

CPU is expressed as a percentage of one core. RSS excludes GPU memory. Shells,
workload processes, the compositor, and the observer are outside the process
samples, though they can affect timing. Input latency ends when the changed cell
arrives in a composited PipeWire frame; it includes capture and readback overhead
and excludes physical display scanout.

Use `--renderer gl` or `--renderer cairo` to change the default Vulkan backend.
`--seconds` and `--samples` control sample sizes. Reports include binary hashes.

## Daemon input

```sh
python3 scripts/frontend-input-smoke-test.py --binary target/release/gmux \
  --measure --report artifacts/frontend-input.json
```

The headless probe measures socket input to the corresponding changed-cell
packet, including the child's PTY response. It compares idle input with input
immediately after visible or hidden pane metadata changes. It excludes GTK,
compositing, and display latency. The suite also checks viewport coalescing,
search pacing, request fairness, and large pastes. `--measure` reports timings
without applying input-latency thresholds.

## Rendering

`crates/gtk/examples/renderer-benchmark.rs` measures scene preparation, completed rendering,
and texture download for unchanged, single-row, scrolling, and full-screen
updates. It reports median and p95 durations, row rebuild counts, and cache sizes.
See [terminal rendering](renderer.md#benchmarks) for commands and timing limits.

## Accessible text

```sh
cargo build --release --locked -p gmux-gtk --example accessible-terminal-benchmark
mkdir -p artifacts
target/release/examples/accessible-terminal-benchmark \
  > artifacts/accessibility-benchmark.json
```

This benchmark isolates text construction for ASCII and Unicode grids. It
compares fresh allocation, retained-buffer rebuilds, and color-only row updates.
It excludes GTK, transport, rendering, and AT-SPI delivery. Timings are calibrated
batch means per operation, not individual input-latency percentiles.
